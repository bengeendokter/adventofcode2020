# Advent of Code 2022
This is my repo for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) written in TypeScript.

Doing this for fun and to practice my TypeScript. Some of the code may be ugly, I will be writing the majority of this on my phone while sitting on the train.

## Install/Run

Choose the day to run by changing the import in [src/main.ts](src/main.ts) file.

Install the needed node packages with:
```
yarn install
```

Run the day with:
```
yarn start
```
